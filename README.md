The Emergency Exit simulation project, developed using AnyLogic software, focuses on replicating real-life scenarios within the Engineering building at Cal Poly University. Leveraging authentic data, the simulation aims to model and analyze emergency evacuation procedures, particularly triggered by an alarm during various times of the day. The simulation incorporates actual class schedules for Tuesdays, allowing for a dynamic representation of occupancy levels within the building. This realistic approach provides valuable insights into how an emergency evacuation would unfold during different periods, considering peak class times and potential challenges.

The simulation not only examines the efficiency of the evacuation process but also serves as a tool for identifying areas of improvement in the building's safety measures. By scrutinizing the movement of individuals during evacuation, the project aims to pinpoint potential bottlenecks, areas of congestion, and any shortcomings in the existing evacuation plan. The insights gained from the simulation can be instrumental in proposing enhancements to the evacuation process, ultimately contributing to a safer environment within the Engineering building. This project, therefore, serves as a valuable tool for both assessing the current state of emergency preparedness and fostering continuous improvement for the safety of the building's occupants.
